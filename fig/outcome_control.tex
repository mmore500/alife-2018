\caption{
End state (update 3000000, cell gen. 6916) of same-channel signaling networks evolved under the control treatment.
Level-one channels are coded by color saturation and level-two channels are coded by color hue.
A single cell-like organism occupies each grid tile except for black tiles, which are empty.
Level-one same-channel groups appear as uniformly-colored clumps, bounded by a white border.
Level-two same-channel groups appear as same-hue amalgamations of level-one groups, bounded by a black border.
