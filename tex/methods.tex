\section{Methods}

We manually designed strategies that organisms could use to cooperate to experimentally demonstrate that the dishtiny framework selects for detectable hierarchical transitions of individuality.

\subsection{dishtiny}
We will begin by discussing at a single hierarchicical level, then lay out how the system scales to multiple levels

* resource distribution

* signaling

This means that at each level organisms benefit from cooperating with a medium-sized, diamond-shaped group : it has to be ``just right'' too small and they'll miss out on resource that passes over; too big and they'll activate erroneously and quickly bankrupt themselves.
They are forced to control the size and shape of this cooperating through their reproductive choices --- offspring .

Interestingly, signaling can lead to a standing wave and kill u

* hierarchy

\subsection{test organisms}

each organism consisted of a set of floating-point values that described

* res_pool

* avoid_over

* off_ch_cap

* sort_off

* damage_suicide

We would expect a zero-level individual to exhibit a genotype along the lines of

We would expect a first-level individual to exhibit a genotype along the lines of

Finally, we would expect a second-level individual to exhibit a genotype along the lines of
