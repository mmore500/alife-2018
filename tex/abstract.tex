To this end, we introduce the DISHTINY framework.
seeks to achieve this by making organisms explicitly register in cooperating groups (``channels'') to cooperate spatiotemporally to maximize the harvest of a resource.
Then, detecting transitions of individuality simply by looking for the presence of resource-sharing and reproductive division of labor among organisms sharing a channel and the absence among organisms *not* sharing a channel.
We believe that one of the most interesting properties of our system this abstraction is organized so that it can scale to an arbitrary number of hierarchical levels.
We see the ability to select for an arbitrary number of evolutionary transitions as an important step to achieving open-ended scale in artificial life that more closely resembles that of biological life.
