\section{Conclusion}

our evolving organisms are not open-ended
simply evolving parameters for some rather crude manually-designed strategies
while sufficient to demonstrate that the environment selects for genetic strategies that program for higher-level individuality, these results are not full-fledged
but they show potential for it and that's our next step

briefly, how to integrate open-ended organisms into dishtiny

also, study major transitions --- questions about phenotypic plasticity, etc. (look at grant proposal)
