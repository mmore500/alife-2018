\section{Results}

trajectory of evolutionary genetic paths

reproductive division of labor observed
altruistic suicide observed
resource sharing observed


phenotype progression

generation times

resource harvested by time,
  regressed on population's genetic composition

ecological experiments?
  possibly not fair because somatic mutation
