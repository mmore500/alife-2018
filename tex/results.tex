A spectrum of resource allocation strategies were observed at the conclusion of different runs of our evolutionary simulation (mean generation 37,168; $s=4,684$).
We interpret these outcomes as ranging between first-level and second-level individuality.
The criteria used to discern these outcomes are described below.
Figure \ref{fig:outcome_grids} shows the level-one and level-two signaling networks at the end of runs where first-, split-, and second-level resource allocation evolved, respectively.
First-level individuals form somewhat irregular level-two amalgamations of diverse level-one networks.
Second-level individuals form highly regular diamond-shaped level-two signaling networks.
Split-allocation individuals exhibit a level-two phenotype of intermediate regularity.
Figure \ref{fig:grid_progression} shows a time series of signaling network snapshots in an evolutionary run where second-level individuality evolved.

Figure \ref{fig:genotypes} describes predominant genotypes observed at the end of our evolutionary simulations.
All evolved genotypes had $A_2$ fixed at $1.0$.
So, reproduction over cells sharing the same level-two channel was universally avoided;
genotypes evolved so that cells declined to reproduce when they were located at the interior of level-two same-channel signaling networks.

However, a variety of resource-caching strategies evolved.
Most-abundant genotypes at the end of evolutionary runs included strategies where resource was primarily cached in an organism's individual stockpile (i.e., $P_{c} > P_1, P_2$), strategies where resource was primarily cached in an organism's level-one signaling network's pool (i.e., $P_1 > P_{c}, P_2$), and strategies where resource was primarily cached in an organism's level-two signaling network's pool (i.e., $P_2 > P_{c}, P_1$).
Among 50 trials, pure first-level allocation dominated at the end of nine replicates, primarily level-one split resource-sharing dominated in seven replicates, and primarily level-two split resource sharing dominated in 34 replicates.
We suspect that a trade-off between growth rate and long-term stability contributed to our observation of split resource sharing strategies.
Cell- and level-one resource caching might function something like saving for a rainy day.
Because reproduction over level-two channel-mates was universally avoided, cells and level-one same-channel networks situated at the interior of a larger level-two same-channel network do not expend their resource pools unless the larger level-one same-channel network is damaged, exposing them to directly-adjacent cells of a different level-one channel.
Thus, resource accumulates in cells and level-one pools until the level-one same-channel network comes under stress.
Split allocation might also represent hedging against defection of a second-level channel-mate by via mutation.

We selection for apoptosis
Excluding replicates where exclusive first-level resource caching dominated, standard evolutionary runs at update 20 million, mean population mean $M_{c}$ was $0.67$, standard deviation 0.33, $n=42$.
This is significantly greater than the value $M_{c} = 0.5$ we would expect in the absence of a selective pressure for an apoptosis response to mutation ($p < 0.05$, test TODO).

To assess whether higher-level individuals were more likely to employ apoptosis to mitigate somatic mutation, we examined the relationship between first- and second-level resource pooling and cellular apoptosis at the conclusion of our 33 replicate evolutionary trials.
We observed a significant negative correlation between dominant genotype $P_1$ and $M_{c}$ ($p < 0.05$; bootstrap test; Figure \ref{fig:champion_res_pool1_vs_champion_damage_suicide0}) and a significant positive correlation between dominant genotype $P_2$ and $M_{c}$ ($p < 0.05$; bootstrap test; Figure \ref{fig:champion_res_pool2_vs_champion_damage_suicide0}).
This result suggests that second-level individuals, in particular, relied on apoptosis to mitigate somatic mutation.


To assess whether higher-level individuals provided larger resource endowments to their propagules (offspring sharing neither the level-one nor the level-two channel ID with the parent), we examined the relationship between first and second-level resource pooling and dominant genotype second-level propagule endowment at the conclusion of our 50 replicate evolutionary trials.
We observed a significant negative correlation between dominant genotype $P_1$ and $E_2$ ($p < 0.05$; bootstrap test) and a significant positive correlation between dominant genotype $P_2$ and $E_2$ ($p <  0.005$; bootstrap test).
Second-level individuals might provide larger endowments to propagules simply due to a greater capacity to collect resource or perhaps because of stronger selection for well-endowed offspring when competing against other second-level individuals.

We also observed a significant positive correlation between first-level resource sharing and first-level endowment ($p < 0.0001$; bootstrap test) and a significant negative correlation between second-level resource sharing and first-level endowment ($p < 0.0001$; bootstrap test).

\subsection{Competition Experiments}

Next, we wanted to compare cell-, first-, and second-level individuals to determine which genotype was the most fit in the DISHTINY platform environment.
We ran competition experiments between the the dominant genotypes from the run with greatest mean $P_{c}$, the run with greatest mean $P_1$, and the run with greatest mean $P_2$.
The a mean of $90.2 \%$ of the , standard deviation $3.8 \%$.
%In 22 out of 191 trials performed fixation was reached by update 1.5 million.
TODO replace with info on dominance
The second-level resource caching strategy was most abundant at update 1.5 million of all 50 trials.
These results show that in the absence of mutation, second-level individuals tend to exhibit greater fitness than evenly-split-allocation and first-level individuals ($p < 0.0001$; two-tailed exact test).

Figure \ref{fig:eco_progression} shows a time series of signaling network snapshots in an competition experiment run.
Colonies of each genotype can be seen to grow from each seed and then clash, yielding

In competition experiments, however, higher-level individuals likely benefited from elimination of somatic mutation.
To assess the relative fitness of first- and second-level individuals without mutation disabled, we examined the relationship between first- and second-level resource pooling and the rate of cellular reproduction at the end of each of the 50 replicate evolutionary trials performed.
We observed a significant negative correlation between mean $P_1$ and cellular reproduction rate ($p < 0.0001$; bootstrap test; Figure \ref{fig:mean_res_pool1_vs_net_reproduction}) and a significant positive correlation between mean $P_2$ and cellular reproduction rate ($p < 0.0001$; bootstrap test; Figure \ref{fig:mean_res_pool2_vs_net_reproduction}).
This result suggests that second-level individuals tend to collect resource more effectively than evenly-split-allocation and first-level individuals.
