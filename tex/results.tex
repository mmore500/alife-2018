Cell-, first-, and second-level individuals were all observed at the conclusion of different runs of our evolutionary simulation (mean generation 22,016; $s=3,119$).
The criteria used to discern these outcomes are described below.
Figure \ref{fig:outcome_grids} shows the level-one and level-two signaling networks at the end of runs where cell-, first-, and second-level individuality evolved, respectively.
Figure \ref{fig:grid_progression} shows a time series of signaling network snapshots in an evolutionary run where first-level individuality evolved.
Cell-level individuals appear to form with comparatively large level-one signaling networks that are arranged into amorphous level-two signaling networks.
Zeroth-level individuals appear to form elongated cigar-shaped level-two amalgamations of diverse level-one networks.
First-level individuals appear to form highly regular diamond-shaped level-two amalgamations of diverse level-one networks.

Figure \ref{fig:genotypes} describes predominant genotypes observed at the end of our evolutionary simulations.
With a single exception, nearly all evolved genotypes had $A_2$ fixed at or very near $1.0$ (i.e., population mean $A_2 \geq 0.993$).
So, reproduction over cells sharing the same level-two channel was near-universally avoided;
genotypes evolved so that cells declined to reproduce when they were located at the interior of level-two same-channel signaling networks.

However, a variety of resource-caching strategies evolved.
Most-abundant genotypes at the end of evolutionary runs included strategies where resource was primarily cached in an organism's individual stockpile (i.e., $P_{c} > P_1, P_2$), strategies where resource was primarily cached in an organism's level-one signaling network's pool (i.e., $P_1 > P_{c}, P_2$), and strategies where resource was primarily cached in an organism's level-two signaling network's pool (i.e., $P_2 > P_{c}, P_1$).
Among 33 trials, selfish cell-level hoarders dominated at the end of two replicates, level-one resource-sharing dominated in 16 replicates, and level-two resource sharing dominated in 15 replicates.

Given the near-ubiquitous nature of cooperation with regard to reproductive division of labor at the level-two same-channel signaling network, it was on this basis of resource caching strategy that we drew distinctions between cell-, first-, and second-level individuality.
(The single predominant genotype with $A_2 = 0.91$ had $P_1 = 1.0$, so was not sharing resource on the level-two same-channel resource pool).
% @CAO: I'm not sure where this final parenthetical came from.  I take it this is the single "selfish" individual in the second example above?
% @MAM: Exactly.

Next, we wanted to compare cell-, first-, and second-level individuals to determine which genotype was the most fit in the DISHTINY platform environment.
We ran ecological competitions between the the dominant genotypes from the run with greatest mean $P_{c}$, the run with greatest mean $P_1$, and the run with greatest mean $P_2$.
In 22 out of 191 trials performed fixation was reached by update 1.5 million.  The cell-level individuality genotype dominated in one trial, the first-level individuality genotype dominated in 12 trials, and the first-level individuality genotype dominated in 178 trials.
These results show that in the absence of mutation, first-level individuals tend to exhibit greater fitness than first- and cell-level individuals ($p < 0.0001$; RR 2.8; two-tailed exact test).

In ecological competition, however, higher-level individuals likely benefited from elimination of somatic mutation.
To assess the relative fitness of first- and second-level individuals without mutation disabled, we examined the relationship between first- and second-level resource pooling and the rate of cellular reproduction at the end of each of the 33 replicate evolutionary trials performed.
We observed a significant negative correlation between mean $P_1$ and cellular reproduction rate ($p < 0.0001$; bootstrap test; Figure \ref{fig:mean_res_pool1_vs_net_reproduction}) and a significant positive correlation between mean $P_2$ and cellular reproduction rate ($p < 0.0001$; bootstrap test; Figure \ref{fig:mean_res_pool2_vs_net_reproduction}).
This result suggests that second-level individuals tend to collect resource more effectively than first-level individuals.
We did not test correlation between $P_{c}$ and reproduction rate due to the small number of trials where cell-level individuality dominated.

With the viability of cell-, first-, and second-level individuality in the DISHTINY platform environment --- and the greater relative fitness of second-level individuality --- established, we were also interested in probing the strategies employed by cell-, first-, and second-level individuals beyond resource caching and reproductive deferment.
To assess whether higher-level individuals employed apoptosis to mitigate somatic mutation, we examined the relationship between first- and second-level resource pooling and cellular apoptosis at the conclusion of our 33 replicate evolutionary trials.
We observed a significant negative correlation between dominant genotype $P_1$ and $M_{c}$ ($p < 0.0001$; bootstrap test; Figure \ref{fig:champion_res_pool1_vs_champion_damage_suicide0}) and a significant positive correlation between dominant genotype $P_2$ and $M_{c}$ ($p < 0.0001$; bootstrap test; Figure \ref{fig:champion_res_pool2_vs_champion_damage_suicide0}).
Notably, no genotype encoding second-level individuality was observed with $M_{c} < 0.5$.
This result suggests that second-level individuals, in particular, relied on apoptosis to mitigate somatic mutation, perhaps due to their much larger scale compared to cell- and first-level individuals.

To assess whether higher-level individuals provided larger resource endowments to their propagules (offspring sharing neither the level-one nor the level-two channel ID with the parent), we examined the relationship between first and second-level resource pooling and dominant genotype second-level propagule endowment at the conclusion of our 33 replicate evolutionary trials.
We observed a significant negative correlation between dominant genotype $P_1$ and $E_2$ ($p < 0.001$; bootstrap test) and a significant positive correlation between dominant genotype $P_2$ and $E_2$ ($p <  0.0001$; bootstrap test).
Second-level individuals might provide larger endowments to propagules simply due to a greater capacity to collect resource or perhaps because of stronger selection for well-endowed offspring when competing against other second-level individuals.
