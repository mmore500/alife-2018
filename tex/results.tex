A spectrum of resource allocation strategies were observed at the conclusion of different runs of our evolutionary simulation (mean generation 37,168; $s=4,684$).
We interpret these outcomes as ranging between first-level and second-level individuality.
The criteria used to discern these outcomes are described below.
Figure \ref{fig:outcome_grids} shows the level-one and level-two signaling networks at the end of runs where first-, split-, and second-level resource allocation evolved, respectively.
First-level allocators form somewhat irregular level-two amalgamations of diverse level-one networks.
Second-level allocators form highly regular diamond-shaped level-two signaling networks.
Split-allocation individuals exhibit a level-two phenotype of intermediate regularity.
Figure \ref{fig:grid_progression} shows a time series of signaling network snapshots in an evolutionary run where second-level individuality evolved.

Figure \ref{fig:genotypes} describes predominant genotypes observed at the end of our evolutionary simulations.
All evolved genotypes had $A_2$ fixed at $1.0$.
So, reproduction over cells sharing the same level-two channel was universally avoided;
genotypes evolved so that cells declined to reproduce when they were located at the interior of level-two same-channel signaling networks.

However, a variety of resource-caching strategies evolved.
Most-abundant genotypes at the end of nine evolutionary runs exclusively cached resource in organisms' level-one signaling network's pool (i.e., $P_1 = 1.0$).
We observed strategies where resource was primarily, but not entirely, cached in an organism's level-one signaling network pool (i.e., $1.0 > P_1 > P_2$) as the most-abundant genotype at the end of seven evolutionary runs.
In one run, the most-abundant final genotype split resources evenly between an organism's level-one and level-two signaling network pool ($P_1 = P_2 = 0.5$).
Finally, we observed strategies where resource was primarily, but not entirely, cached in an organism's level-two signaling network pool (i.e., $1.0 > P_2 > P_1$) as the most-abundant genotype at the end of 33 evolutionary runs.
We suspect that a trade-off between growth rate and long-term stability contributed to our observation of split resource sharing strategies.
Cell- and level-one resource caching might function something like saving for a rainy day.
Because reproduction over level-two channel-mates was universally avoided, cells and level-one same-channel networks situated at the interior of a larger level-two same-channel network do not expend their resource pools unless the larger level-one same-channel network is damaged, exposing them to directly-adjacent cells of a different level-one channel.
Thus, resource accumulates in cells and level-one pools until the level-one same-channel network comes under stress.
Split allocation might also represent hedging against defection of a second-level channel-mate by via somatic mutation.

Indeed, we did observe selection for apoptosis in the 41 replicates where the dominant genotype employed second-level resource caching.
In these replicates, the average population mean value of $M_{c}$ was 0.68 with standard deviation 0.33, significantly greater than the value $M_{c} = 0.5$ we would expect in the absence of a selective pressure on apoptosis response to mutation ($p < 0.001$, bootstrap test).

To assess whether heavy second-level resource allocators, which we characterize as higher-level individuals, were more likely to employ apoptosis to mitigate somatic mutation, we examined the relationship between first- and second-level resource pooling and cellular apoptosis at the conclusion of our 50 replicate evolutionary trials.
We observed a significant negative correlation between dominant genotype $P_1$ and $M_{c}$ ($p < 0.05$; bootstrap test; Figure \ref{fig:champion_res_pool1_vs_champion_damage_suicide0}) and a significant positive correlation between dominant genotype $P_2$ and $M_{c}$ ($p < 0.05$; bootstrap test; Figure \ref{fig:champion_res_pool2_vs_champion_damage_suicide0}).
This result suggests that second-level individuals, in particular, relied on apoptosis to mitigate somatic mutation.

We also assessed whether higher-level individuals provided larger resource endowments to their second-level propagules (offspring sharing neither the level-one nor the level-two channel ID with the parent).
We examined the relationship between first and second-level resource pooling and dominant genotype second-level propagule endowment at the conclusion of our 50 replicate evolutionary trials.
We observed a significant negative correlation between dominant genotype $P_1$ and $E_2$ ($p < 0.05$; bootstrap test) and a significant positive correlation between dominant genotype $P_2$ and $E_2$ ($p <  0.005$; bootstrap test).
Second-level individuals might provide larger endowments to propagules simply due to a greater capacity to collect resource or perhaps because of stronger selection for well-endowed offspring when competing against other second-level individuals.

This result prompts the reverse question: do lower-level individuals provide  larger resource endowments to first-level propagules (offspring that do not share level-one channel ID with the parent but may or may not share level-two channel ID with the parent).
Indeed, we observed a significant positive correlation between first-level resource sharing and first-level endowment ($p < 0.0001$; bootstrap test) and a significant negative correlation between second-level resource sharing and first-level endowment ($p < 0.0001$; bootstrap test).
Cells that pool resource with their smaller level-one same-channel group tend to invest more heavily into the direct offshoots of their level-one same-channel group than cells that pool resource with their larger level-two same-channel group.
This observation suggests that, although cells do not directly displace their level-one channel-mates, competitive dynamics between may be at play more conservative

\subsection{Competition Experiments}

\input{fig/eco_progression.tex}

\input{fig/outcome_control.tex}

Next, we wanted to compare first-, second-, and split-level allocators to determine which genotype was the most fit.
We ran competition experiments between dominant genotypes from evolutionary runs representative of each of these strategies.
To represent first-level allocators, we selected randomly from the nine pure first-level allocator dominant genotypes we observed.
To represent the split-level allocators, we selected the single dominant genotype where resource was partitioned exactly evenly between first- and second-level channel pools.
To represent second-level allocators, we selected the dominant genotype with the largest second-level allocation proportion.
Figure \ref{fig:genotypes} enumerates the three representative genotypes used.
Figure \ref{fig:eco_progression} shows a time series of signaling network snapshots in an competition experiment run.
Colonies of each genotype can be seen to grow from each seed and then clash, ultimately yielding a population dominated by second-level allocators.

Indeed, the second-level resource caching strategy became most abundant in all 50 trials.
Across the 50 replicates, the second-level resource caching strategy constituted $90.2 \%$, with standard deviation $3.8 \%$, of the competing population of cells.
In the absence of mutation, second-level individuals tend to exhibit greater fitness than evenly-split-allocation and first-level individuals ($p < 0.0001$; two-tailed exact test).


\input{fig/net_reproduction.tex}

In competition experiments, however, higher-level individuals likely benefited from elimination of somatic mutation.
To assess the relative fitness of first- and second-level individuals without mutation disabled, we examined the relationship between first- and second-level resource pooling and the rate of cellular reproduction at the end of each of the 50 replicate evolutionary trials performed.
We observed a significant negative correlation between mean $P_1$ and cellular reproduction rate ($p < 0.0001$; bootstrap test; Figure \ref{fig:mean_res_pool1_vs_net_reproduction}) and a significant positive correlation between mean $P_2$ and cellular reproduction rate ($p < 0.0001$; bootstrap test; Figure \ref{fig:mean_res_pool2_vs_net_reproduction}).
This result suggests that second-level individuals tend to collect resource more effectively than evenly-split-allocation and first-level individuals.
